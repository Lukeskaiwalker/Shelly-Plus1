# Shelly-Plus1
Because i didnâ€™t find anything else on the internet.
I started this repository for those ho where also wondering why ESP Home was not working when selected a generic ESP32 board at board type. I found another post from someone on the ESP Home GitHub page, where the person posting it was describing a similar problem but not with a Shelly +1.
Here is a link to the direkt post: https://github.com/esphome/issues/issues/1560#issuecomment-866286717.
